# Adlar Heatpump (Aurora II) — Home Assistant Integration

A HACS-compatible custom integration for the **Adlar Castra Aurora II** heat pump, communicating over **Modbus TCP** via an RS485-to-WiFi gateway.

No YAML required. All setup is done through the Home Assistant UI.

---

## Hardware setup

This integration was developed and tested with the following hardware:

- **JPX-3002** RS485 splitter (2 master / 1 slave):
  - **Slave port** → Modbus RS485 cable from the heat pump
  - **Master 1** → JAN module (original controller)
  - **Master 2** → Elfin EW11A (RS485 to WiFi/TCP bridge)
- The **Elfin EW11A** configured as TCP Server on port **502**
- Modbus slave ID of the heat pump: **1** (default)

Any RS485-to-Modbus-TCP bridge should work (Waveshare, USR-W610, etc.).

---

## Elfin EW11 configuration

**Serial Port Settings:**
- Baud Rate: `9600`
- Data Bit: `8`
- Stop Bit: `1`
- Parity: `None`
- Buffer Size: `1024`
- Gap Time: `100`

**Communication Settings:**
- Protocol: `TCP Server`
- Local Port: `502`

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Open **HACS → Integrations**
2. Click the three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**
3. Add this repository URL, category: **Integration**
4. Search for **Adlar Heatpump** and install
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual

Copy the `custom_components/adlar_heatpump/` folder into your HA `config/custom_components/` directory, then restart.

---

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**
2. Search for **Adlar Heatpump**
3. Enter:
   - **IP address** of your RS485-TCP gateway
   - **Port** (default `502`)
   - **Slave ID** (default `1`)
   - **Scan interval** in seconds (default `60`)

## Technical notes

### Modbus addressing
This integration applies a **-1 address offset** to sensor registers (`0x0040`–`0x0085`). The Aurora II firmware uses 1-based register addressing in this range, while pymodbus uses 0-based addressing. Control registers (`0x0300`+) and status registers (`0x0000`) do not require this correction.

### Registers not available on R32 model
The following registers always return 0 on the R32 (Aurora II) model and are excluded:
- `0x0044` AC Input Voltage
- `0x0047` Compressor IPM Temperature

### Scan interval
The default scan interval is 60 seconds. With ~40 registers × 200ms delay = ~8 seconds per poll cycle, a minimum of 30 seconds is recommended.
